#### Hey, Iâ€™m [Calvin](https://calvintalbot.com) ðŸ‘‹ 

#### Iâ€™ve spent over a decade in software engineering, mainly in fintech, supply chain automation, and app development. These days, Iâ€™m leading dev teams and building cool software. Iâ€™m a big believer in being passionate about what you do, so my spare time is spent exploring new tech, boosting my skills, and working on personal projects. Outside of tech, youâ€™ll find me enjoying life with my wife and two kids ðŸ–¤
